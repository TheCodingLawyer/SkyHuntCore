# VoidGen Configuration
# This configures the void world generator for SkyHuntCore

# Generator type: void (completely empty), flat (single layer), or custom
type: void

# For void worlds, we don't need layers since it's completely empty
# Islands are generated by SkyHuntCore's IslandManager instead

# If you want a flat world instead of void, uncomment and configure:
# layers:
#   - material: BEDROCK
#     height: 1
#   - material: STONE
#     height: 60
#   - material: DIRT
#     height: 3
#   - material: GRASS_BLOCK
#     height: 1

# Biome for the world
biome: PLAINS

# World border (optional)
# border:
#   size: 10000
#   center_x: 0
#   center_z: 0
